# Autonomous Experiment Architecture

A clear and safe architecture for building human-supervised autonomous
experimental systems. The framework is based on eight layers, starting
from design and basic stability (Layer 0) up to scientific reasoning
and hypothesis suggestions (Layer 7). At every layer, safety measures
and human oversight remain central.

## Goals

- Define a transparent structure for autonomous experiments
- Keep humans responsible for all scientific and safety-critical decisions
- Provide mechanisms for anomaly handling and conflict resolution
- Use digital models (“twins”) for testing and validation
- Encourage careful development of future autonomous systems in science
